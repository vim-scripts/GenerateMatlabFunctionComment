Generates a comment skeleton for a matlab function. 

For example:
function xs = get_slantx(x, y, angle)
When the script (VERSION 0.3) is run on this line the output is like:
function xs = get_slantx(x, y, angle)
% get_slantx  
% 
% Input:
% ^^^^^^
% . x
% . y
% . angle
%
% Output:
% ^^^^^^^
% . xs
%% AUTHOR  Author Name

This format is compatible with Matdoc. See version comments below to know more about Matdoc.

For previous versions the output looks similar to:
% get_slantx   
% function xs = get_slantx(x, y, angle)
% PARAM xs [OUT] 
% PARAM x [IN] 
% PARAM y [IN] 
% PARAM angle [IN] 
% AUTHOR  Author Name

This script is derived from MakeDoxygenComment by Leif Wickland.

After the installation you can run the script simply by hitting <ALT+c> when the cursor is on function line.
